<h1>The Best Movies Ever According to Brandon Dilts</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Alien</h3>
<p>One of the best horror sci-fi movies ever made with awesome animitronics and set design. No movie has better atmosphere </p>

<h3>Predator</h3>
<p>The best qualities of action, horror, thriller, sci-fi movies all in one film. With practical effects that still are impressive to this day. Incredibly entertaining, and endlessly quotable.</p>

<h3>Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors</h3>
<p>My favorite slasher changes a lot between many films, but I always find time to rewatch arguably the strongest entry in the elm street franchise. Likable characters, entertaining deaths, and Freddy is at his best. </p>
