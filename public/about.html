<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Brandon Dilts and I graduated from the Univeristy of Iowa in 2022 with a Bachelors of Science in mathematics, joined 
  with minors in computer science, economics, and philosophy. I grew up in Cedar Rapids and have spent the vast majority
  of my life in front of a screen (for better or for worst). I love to learn knew things and coding has been a great outlet to
  do just that.
</p>

<p>I have formal academic experiences utilizing python, java, and C. I didn't feel satisfied with just this, so in my free time 
  since graduating college I have gone on to learn SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through online resources. I do not intend to 
  stop there as I am extremely passionate about this field, and I hope to one day enter this fascinating industry.
</p>

<p>In my free time I entertain other nerdy hobbies such as card games like magic the gathering, 3d printing custom board games, 
  a wide variety of video games, and movies (with horror being my favorite genre). Thank you for reading this far and I hope you have a wonderful
  day!
